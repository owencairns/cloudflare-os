// (removalBlockedByRestrictedData, assertNewSharingAllowed) already holds -- including across the
// excluded observers' awaited cross-worker teardown, during which the producer must not become
// removable nor new sharing grantable. And a restricted observation arriving through an
// already-removed connection (an in-flight facet RPC can outlive removeGatekeeper) is refused
// rather than latched: with zero collaborators it would sail past the coverage check's early
// return, and latching a missing producer id would permanently brick sharing via
// assertNewSharingAllowed's missing-record branch.
//
// Runs against a real OverseerDurableObject (the TEST_OVERSEER binding, like
// restricted-producer-removal.test.ts); the gatekeeper facet is the only fake.
